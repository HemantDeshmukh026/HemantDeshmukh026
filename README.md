- **⚡ Fun fact:** In the early days of computing, punch cards were a popular method for inputting data. One of the pioneers in computer programming, Grace Hopper, found an actual bug (a 
              moth) causing a malfunction in the Mark II computer in 1947. This led to the term "debugging" when fixing software issues. Today, while we no longer find moths in our 
              computers, debugging remains a crucial part of the data engineering and analysis process! 🐛💻
